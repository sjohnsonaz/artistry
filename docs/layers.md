# Layers

We can organize our content into four distinct layers.

## Root Layer

This is for general content.  It affects the main scrollbar.  When the Overlay Layer is active, it does not scroll.

* Content
* Popover
* Tooltip
* Lock

## Fixed Layer

This is for header and footer content.  All contents should be fixed.  It does not affect the main scrollbar.

* Top Menu

* Footer

## Overlay Layer

This is for content which stack on top of the main content.  Contents scroll as necessary.  If possible, it should affect the main scrollbar.

* Modals
* Drawers

## Flyout Layer

This is for small elements which float over the content.  All contents should be fixed.  It does nto affect the main scrollbar.
